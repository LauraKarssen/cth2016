<p>For this assignment you will be developing a command line interface for a fake &quot;bookstore&quot;. Using the node library <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander">commander</a> you will make available a command line interface to your program which, when executed, will output information of books that match the following criteria: (1) book title, (2) author name, (3) price, and (4) kind (paperback or hardcover).</p>
<p>In order to gather data for your script, select 5 books from either the <a href="http://www.athenaeum.nl">Athenaeum Boekhandel</a> or the <a href="http://www.abc.nl">American Book Center</a> and construct a simple &quot;hardcoded&quot; database out of these (see example from the class).</p>
