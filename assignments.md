## Assignment #1

For this assignment you will be developing a command line interface for a fake "bookstore". Using the node library [commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) you will make available a command line interface to your program which, when executed, will output information of books that match the following criteria: (1) book title, (2) author name, (3) price, and (4) kind (paperback or hardcover).

In order to gather data for your script, select 5 books from either the [Athenaeum Boekhandel](http://www.athenaeum.nl) or the [American Book Center](http://www.abc.nl) and construct a simple "hardcoded" database out of these (see example from the class).

Below are two examples of inputs and outputs where the data was taken from the Athenaeum Boekhandel

```
$ node bookstore.js --author "Hans Ulrich Orbist"

Title: Ways of Curating
Author: Hans Ulrich Orbist
Price: 16.95
Kind: Paperback

```

```
$ node bookstore.js --title "The Hatred of Poetry"

Title: The Hatred of Poetry
Author: Ben Lerner
Price: 13.95
Kind: Paperback
```
